Value Addition: 
I have taken the flashcard R script from github.com/jienagu/flashCard_Shiny_Demo and added the following features: 
1. Option to import an excel file with column headers i.e. Topic, Question, Definition, Examples, Comments; 
2. Alternatively; there is an option to create standard template for flashcard; that could be downloaded as csv or excel file; 
3. Option to upload an excel file. The template could be updated and loaded back to the package 
4. Option to view the dataset as table 
5. Option to filter the questions by topic;
